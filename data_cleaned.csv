Each of the three SOPs also notes that her focus is now on academics, and that we should just believe her on THAT.

Reviews based on this year's SOP do not take into consideration last year's SOP which identifies SW motivation and dedication.  As a part time student with required academic resources, I believe the student would add perspective to the classroom. Defer SOP's are 1-2 pages and are instructed to say why they deferred and are not ready for the program - which I believe is why the applicant so heavily focused on it not being a choice.  not the best way to present herself but understandable.","Now that there are letters that support her, I can score that area. Seems to feel she has abiity to do well and demonstrates leadership ability.No LORs to read so cannot know of references input. GPA 2.82 from CSULB. Wrintg poor in this year's SOP compared to last year. Appreciate frustration she feels but a better way to express this than in marginal at best new SOP.I am sure she could manage this as she is applying for part time I believe. With limited information it is hard to calculate without LOR score.
